# flask-cupcake

Part Zero: Set Up
Make a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

Make your project a Git repo.

Part One: Cupcake Model
Create Cupcake model in models.py.

It should have the following columns:

id: a unique primary key that is an auto-incrementing integer
flavor: a not-nullable text column
size: a not-nullable text column
rating: a not-nullable column that is a float
image: a non-nullable text column. If an image is not given, default to https://tinyurl.com/demo-cupcake
Make a database called cupcakes.

Once you’ve made this, you can run our seed.py file to add a few sample cupcakes to your database.

Part Two: Listing, Getting & Creating Cupcakes
Make routes for the following:

GET /api/cupcakes
Get data about all cupcakes.

Respond with JSON like: {cupcakes: [{id, flavor, size, rating, image}, ...]}.

The values should come from each cupcake instance.

GET /api/cupcakes/[cupcake-id]
Get data about a single cupcake.

Respond with JSON like: {cupcake: {id, flavor, size, rating, image}}.

This should raise a 404 if the cupcake cannot be found.

POST /api/cupcakes
Create a cupcake with flavor, size, rating and image data from the body of the request.

Respond with JSON like: {cupcake: {id, flavor, size, rating, image}}.

Test that these routes work in Insomnia.

We’ve provided tests for these three routes; these test should pass if the routes work properly.

You can run our tests like:

(venv) $ python -m unittest -v tests
Part Three: Update & Delete Cupcakes
Make routes for the following:

PATCH /api/cupcakes/[cupcake-id]
Update a cupcake with the id passed in the URL and flavor, size, rating and image data from the body of the request. You can always assume that the entire cupcake object will be passed to the backend.

This should raise a 404 if the cupcake cannot be found.

Respond with JSON of the newly-updated cupcake, like this: {cupcake: {id, flavor, size, rating, image}}.

DELETE /api/cupcakes/[cupcake-id]
This should raise a 404 if the cupcake cannot be found.

Delete cupcake with the id passed in the URL. Respond with JSON like {message: "Deleted"}.

Test these routes in Insomnia.

Part Four: Write More Tests
Add tests for the PATCH and DELETE routes.

Part Five: Start on the frontend
Make this route:

GET /
This should return an HTML page (via render_template). This page should be entirely static (the route should just render the template, without providing any information on cupcakes in the database). It should show simply have an empty list where cupcakes should appear and a form where new cupcakes can be added.

Write Javascript (using axios and jQuery) that:

queries the API to get the cupcakes and adds to the page
handles form submission to both let the API know about the new cupcake and updates the list on the page to show it
